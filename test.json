Last season, he sported an ERA of over 6.00 with Texas and began this season in Boston with a 6.17 ERA through his first 13 appearances. Improbably, he regained the form that allowed him to register a sub-3.00 ERA his first two years in the league. His first career save came two weeks ago on Sept. 4 when he shut things down against the Phillies. Five scoreless outings in his last six gives Ross fairly considerable leeway to maintain the closer's role for the remaining two weeks of the season.\n\n  Hot Batter Matchups - September 20, 2015 Edit Matchup Criteria     Matchup Info Career Matchup Stats   Batter Pos Game Pitcher AB H XBH HR RBI BB K AVG OBP SLG OPS     X.

When scouring the waiver wire, managers are looking for just one thing - a bat or an arm to put together the strongest two-week sample to close the year. That player could end up being Bour. For the last 30 days, he has hit .300 with six home runs in 100 at-bats. That type of production rivals that of more proven commodities such as Paul Goldschmidt and Anthony Rizzo. The numbers don't have to hold up over the course of an entire season. He needs only to string together a few more games like the ones he's been having.\n\nOther Recent Recommendations: Cliff Pennington, Tommy Pham, Kelby Tomlinson, Nolan Reimold, Corey Seager and Steven Souza.\n\nDraft Kings Value Picks\n\nSP: Mark Buehrle, TOR ($6,000)\nC: Blake Swihart, BOS ($3,400)\n1B: Adrian Gonzalez, LAD ($3,600)\n2B: Rougned Odor, TEX ($3,200)\nSS: Marcus Semien, OAK ($3,200)\n3B: Brett Lawrie, OAK ($3,600)\nOF: Ender Inciarte, ARI ($3,600)"}, {"headline": "Players to Pick Up Week 4", "story": "AMERICAN ATHLETIC\n\nBraeden West, RB, SMU: West and fellow freshman Xavier Jones supplanted Prescott Line in the running game last week against TCU, and West impressed averaging 4.9 yards per carry against a tough defensive front. With opponents likely to sell out to stop dual-threat quarterback Matt Davis, West could see running lanes open up, especially this week against James Madison.\n\nDoroland Dorceus, RB, Memphis: Normally it's tough to recommend a Memphis back given how well the Tigers split carries, but with Cincinnati likely missing its quarterback Gunner Kiel (head) on a short week, the Tigers offense could generate a big lead early, which would mean more action for the Memphis running game. Dorceus is also a good bet to find the end zone, leading his team with four rushing touchdowns.\n\nACC\n\nBrenden Motley, QB, Virginia Tech: Motley's been solid filling in for the injured Michael Brewer (shoulder), throwing for more than 200 yards and two touchdowns in each game he's started. But where he's really been clutch is adding one rushing touchdown in each of those games. This week Motley takes on an East Carolina defense that allowed six touchdowns to Navy last week.\n\nElijah Hood, RB, UNC: Hood has rushed for more than 100 yards in two of his three games this season, including a 138-yard performance against South Carolina in the season opener on just 13 carries. While he does split the backfield duties with Marquise Williams, Hood sees nearly two carries for every one by Williams. Hood not only looks like a good bet this week against Delaware, but also will be relied upon when the Tar Heels enter ACC play.\n\nBIG 12\n\nReginald Davis, WR, Texas Tech: Davis has caught three touchdowns in his last two games, becoming more involved in the offense every week. His opponent this week, TCU, would normally scare off potential suitors, but the Horned Frogs are not as invincible as they once seemed, they allowed SMU to pass for 330 yards last week.\n\nChris Carson, RB, Oklahoma State: Carson topped 100 yards for the first time this season against UTSA and also found the end zone twice. In the past, a matchup with Texas would cause hesitation, but this Longhorns rush defense doesn't invoke the same fear as it once did, allowing 240 yards per game on the ground, which should help Carson start Big 12 play on the right foot.\n\nBIG TEN\n\nJordan Canzeri, RB Iowa: Despite totaling just 49 yards last week against Pitt, Canzeri managed to find the end zone twice. This week, he faces a North Texas defense that has been gouged for 231 yards per game on the ground this season. \n\nC.J. Beathard, QB Iowa: The Hawkeyes present a big mismatch for a North Texas defense that is ranked near the bottom of the nation in both passing and rushing yards allowed. Beathard has three rushing touchdowns on the season and is averaging 8.6 rushes per game, which provides a nice boost to his passing totals.\n\nCONFERENCE USA\n\nTrent Taylor WR, La Tech:  Taylor has recorded 21 receptions for 267 yards in has last two games and has twice as many receptions as any other receiver on the Bulldogs' roster.\n \nDennis Parks, WR, Rice: Parks went off for eight receptions, 163 yards and two touchdowns against North Texas last week. The Owls will be forced to throw if they want to keep pace with Baylor this week.\n\nMAC\n\nDrew Kummer, QB, Miami (OH): Hacker is coming off three-touchdown game in a near-upset of in-state rival Cincinnati. While he's only thrown for more than 250 yards once this season, he faces a leaky Western Kentucky defense that's been torched for 309.7 yards per game this season.\n\nJoe Licata, QB, Buffalo: Licata has yet to throw for more than 250 yards in a game this season, but the senior has a favorable matchup against a Nevada team ranked near the bottom of FBS in both passing yards allowed and passer rating. He could be a capable one-week fill-in if you're in dire need of a competent signal caller. Licata threw for at least three touchdowns in six games last season.\n\nMOUNTAIN WEST\n\nDalyn Dawkins, RB, CSU: Dawkins totaled 177 yards and a touchdown against Colorado before leaving the game with a hamstring injury, which is concerning. After the game, though, he insisted he would be fine for this week's game against a UT-San Antonio team that allows 185 yards per game on the ground.\n\nBrett Rypien/Thomas Stuart QB, Boise State: The Broncos lost starting quarterback Ryan Findley for eight weeks with an ankle injury against Idaho. Boise State has yet to name a starter, but both played well in relief, with Rypien completing 8-of-9 passes for 124 yards and Stuart throwing for 69 yards and one touchdown while adding 46 yards on the ground. Boise State's quarterbacks get to ease into things  with a matchup against a Virginia team tied for 99th in the nation in pass defense.\n\nPAC-12\n\nChristian Powell, RB, Colorado: Powell replaced Michael Adkins II after he left the game with a hamstring injury against Colorado State. Powell wasn't spectacular last week against Colorado State with just 58 yards on 15 carries, but if Adkins misses time, Powell will be the one to carry the rushing load. He ran for 105 yards earlier this season on just eight carries against UMass and has a good matchup against FCS Nicholls State this week.\n\nSEC\n\nSony Michel, WR Georgia: Despite being the No. 2 running back on the Georgia roster, Michel left his mark on the South Carolina defense with two touchdowns, one of which came on a play where he put his shoulder into a defender in the open field at the goal line and sent the defender onto his back. Michel will still continue to see work despite playing behind Nick Chubb, especially in the passing game where he leads all Bulldogs with three touchdowns.  \n\nCody Core, WR, Ole Miss: Core was mentioned in last week's article and didn't disappoint with 123 receiving yards and a touchdown despite playing his toughest foe to date in Alabama, yet the senior is still only owned in two percent of Fantrax leagues. Core has a good matchup this week against Vanderbilt team that allowed 41 points to Ole Miss when the teams met last year. \n\nSUN BELT\n\nMatt Breida, RB, Georgia Southern: Breida has rushed for more than 150 yards in each of his last two games and scored six touchdowns on the ground this season. His opponent this week, Idaho, ranks 125th in the nation in run defense, allowing 271.7 points per game on the ground.\n\nBrooks Haack, QB, UL-Lafayette: There's not a lot of available players who are in great matchups this week in the Sun Belt as most of the studs will be owned and the ones that aren't are playing well above their competition level. Haack, however, might be forced to throw the ball playing against an Akron defense that has been stringent against the run but susceptible through the air. He's still embroiled in a quarterback competition, but his fellow quarterback, Jalen Nixon, has been hampered by a shoulder injury."}, {"headline": "Two QBs Equal None", "story": "An old adage in football is that when you have two quarterbacks, you really have none.  Two storied programs are learning the hard way this season that just because you have a choice, it's not necessarily a good thing.  Elaboration forthcoming.\n\nNo position receives more focus or agonizing scrutiny than quarterback. Because I'm a wordsmith and was a rapper in my former life, I'm going to sync up some of the most high-profile quarterback situations in college football with some top-notch rap songs. Basically, artists or song titles that I think encompass each team's quarterback situation.  Yes, this is really happening.  No, you can't do anything to stop it.\n\nOle Miss - 99 Problems But A QB Ain't One (Jay-Z)\n\nIt would have been great to see Ole Miss coach Hugh Freeze lay this line on Alabama coach Nick Saban at the press conference after Saturday's game: \"If you're having QB problems, I feel bad for you, son.\"  We'll get to Alabama later on.  In reality, the Rebels have far fewer than the 99 problems that Jay-Z had.  They are 3-0 and just scored 43 points on Alabama's supposedly impregnable defense, vaulting into the top 5 of the most recent rankings.\n\nDid you know Ole Miss quarterback Chad Kelly made a rap song ... about himself and his exploits on the field?  I admit this may have been my inspiration for this column.  Do yourself a favor and Google it.  I can't get it out of my head.  He uses the word \"swag\" at least 30 times in the song.  It's amazing.  It may be catchier than the infamous song Miami's Seventh Floor Crew put out in the mid-2000s.  Shout out to G-Reg, Greg Olsen.  I don't think Kelly's rap career is headed anywhere, but he has been transcendent for the Rebels on the gridiron.  In three games, Kelly has racked up 898 yards and 12 touchdowns.  Granted, two games came against cupcake opponents, but Kelly showed his meddle in the Alabama game, completing 18 of 33 passes for 341 yards and three touchdowns, while also rushing for another score.  Hit the field it's going down, Chad Kelly!  The Rebels could not be more pleased with the play of their rapper/quarterback.\n\nOhio State - 0 to 100 (Drake)\n\nThe Buckeyes are still on top of the college football world, winning 16 consecutive games dating to last season, just as Drake has taken on all comers, most recently Meek Mill.  Much was made of the battle in the offseason between Cardale Jones and J.T. Barrett for the starting quarterback job for the defending National Champions.  However, the situation was viewed as an ideal one for coach Urban Meyer.  Both QBs proved extremely capable last season in handling the offense, and it was thought that no matter who started under center, the Buckeyes would be just fine.\n\nWell, as you're probably tired of hearing me say already in this column, each season stands on its own.  The Buckeyes have looked sluggish on offense in all three games, really.  Going through the motions no matter who lines up under center.  They've been so much more talented than their opponents thus far, though, that they've been able to turn things up 0 to 100 real quick.  Basically, Ohio State has looked like a team that simply decides when to turn it on when it has to.  This is fine against Northern Illinois, but may not be advisable against a team like Michigan State.  The Spartans have no such quarterback issues in 2015, as Connor Cook has 695 yards passing and eight touchdowns.  The Buckeyes have a lot of enemies, and the target on their backs this season has made both Jones and Barrett uncomfortable under center.  Or perhaps it is Urban Meyer's unwillingness to simply pick a starter and stick with him.\n\nAlabama - The Real Slim Shady (Eminem)\n\nWill the real Alabama quarterback please stand up?  On paper, Jake Coker is your prototypical quarterback.  He's the Ken doll of college quarterbacks.  Nearly 6-foot-6, 230, absurd arm strength.  If the Terminator played quarterback those would be his attributes.  Jimbo Fisher once said Coker was the most physically gifted quarterback he had ever coached.  This was while he had Jameis \"Crab Legs\" Winston on his roster.  Then why did Cooper Bateman start Saturday's game against Ole Miss?  Why has Coker failed to distinguish himself the last two seasons against quarterbacks who are less physically gifted?  I don't know Coker personally.  He might be the hardest worker in the room, a film junkie and just the product of playing for an incredibly demanding coach in Nick Saban.  The guess here, though, is that Coker, who played well in relief of Bateman on Saturday, gets rattled easily.  He is also slow to diagnose defenses.  Add those two together, and confidence could be the chief factor in Coker's inconsistency.  He wasn't able to shake Blake Sims last year, and he hasn't been able to shake Cooper Bateman this season.  Coker did score four touchdowns Saturday against Ole Miss, but also threw two picks, and it remains to be seen who the Tide will start each week.\n\nGeorgia - Alright (Kendrick Lamar)\n\nI passed over \"All Eyez On Me\" by Tupac, because I could not in good conscience compare mediocre Georgia quarterback Greyson Lambert to arguably the greatest rapper of all time.  Instead, this is an ode to the panicked Georgia bulldogs fan base that was calling for Lambert's head after a dismal Week 2 performance at Vanderbilt.  The graduate transfer set an NCAA accuracy record against South Carolina, completing 24 of 25 passes.  Yes, you read that correctly.  Lambert also threw three touchdowns in the 52-20 rout over the rival Gamecocks.  While South Carolina is clearly not a very good team, Lambert struggled the prior week against an even worse Vanderbilt squad.  Everything's gon be alright for the Bulldogs, particularly if Lambert can lean on running backs Nick Chubb and Sony Michel.  The latter often gets lost in the shuffle due to the publicity given to Chubb, but Michel is an extremely shifty, versatile back in his own right.  He found the end zone three times against South Carolina.  With Auburn looking lost and Alabama losing to Ole Miss, the Bulldogs could be ready to ascend to the top of the SEC.  Lambert does not need to be perfect, though.  Georgia has enough talent.\n\nNotre Dame - Forgot about Dame (Dr. Dre)\n\nForgive the play on words here.  In any event, hip-hop would not be what it is today without Dr. Dre.  And whether you like it or not, college football isn't the same without Notre Dame.  Remember when Dr. Dre came back, after everyone thought he was finished?  He signed Eminem, released 2001, and suddenly was resurrected.  Just like everyone Forgot About Dre, they also Forgot about Notre Dame.  The Irish are starting their third quarterback since the end of last season.  Everett Golson and Brian Kelly simply could not coexist, and Notre Dame decided to go with the youth movement with Malik Zaire.  It worked -- for two-plus games.  Zaire broke his ankle against Virginia, and will miss the rest of the season.  Enter DeShone Kizer. The sophomore threw the game-winning touchdown in relief of Zaire at Virginia in Week 2, then piloted a 30-22 victory over a Georgia Tech squad that looked unbeatable the first two games of the year.  Notre Dame has now beaten three power conference teams in a row to begin the year (yes, Texas still counts as a power conference team).  Written off, Notre Dame instead keeps piling up victories.  \n\nThe Irish should be Straight Outta Quarterbacks.  Instead, they're still undefeated with the College Football Playoff in their sights."}, {"headline": "Who to Play, Who to Bench Week 4", "story": "PLAYERS TO START\n\nConnor Cook, QB, Michigan State (vs. Central Michigan)\nCook is thought of as more of a guy with a nice pro future than a guy who racks up fantasy points in college, but he's a talented player capable of putting up good numbers in the right matchup. Last week he threw for four touchdowns against Air Force, and he has eight touchdowns to one interception on the season. Central Michigan gave up 30 points to Syracuse, who had to dig deep into their quarterback depth chart, so Cook should be able to have another big game against his intrastate opponent.\n\nTommy Armstrong, QB, Nebraska (vs. Southern Miss)\nThe Cornhuskers have taken a couple rough losses already, but scoring points has not been a problem. Armstrong did throw three picks last week, but he also tossed four touchdowns, and he has nine touchdowns to four interceptions on the season. Southern Miss plays a lot of high-scoring games as well, so this could be a shootout, which would behoove Armstrong and his fantasy numbers.\n\nJeff Driskel, QB, Louisiana Tech (vs. Florida International)\nDriskel struggled at Florida, but the move to Louisiana Tech has gone well for him, as he's currently leading an offense that is 11th in passing yards per game in the FBS. He's also run for four touchdowns, making him a true dual threat. FIU is better than in the last couple of years, but they still aren't good enough to really threaten Driskel and the Bulldogs.\n\nC.J. Prosise, RB, Notre Dame (vs. Massachusetts)\nInjuries have hit the Fighting Irish particularly hard, including at running back, but Prosise has helped to stabilize that situation with his excellent play. Two weeks ago, he rushed for 155 yards and a touchdown against Virginia, and last week he took it up a notch and ran for 198 yards and three scores. UMass will be the easiest opponent Prosise has faced thus far, so this matchup is particularly enticing.\n\nJordan Canzeri, RB, Iowa (vs. North Texas)\nCanzeri has only rushed for 201 yards over three games, but he barely played in Iowa's opening win over Illinois State. However, he's rushed for four touchdowns and he's a real contributor in the passing game, as he has 12 catches for 139 yards so far. This is as much about the matchup, though, because North Texas has allowed 31 points to SMU and 38 points to Rice in their two games so far, and they are allowing 231 yards per game on the ground. That should give Canzeri the chance to have a big game.\n\nKenyan Drake, RB, Alabama (vs. Louisiana-Monroe)\nLast week wasn't fun for the Crimson Tide, but they get to right the ship with a visit from Louisiana-Monroe, and they probably won't be in the mood to show mercy. Derrick Henry is the clear lead running back for Alabama, but this is the kind of game that can provide more than one runner with a fantasy bounty. This is especially true if Alabama gets out to a big lead, which seems likely, and decide to rest Henry and let Drake churn up yards running out the clock.\n\nMichael Thomas, WR, Ohio State (vs. Western Michigan)\nYes, now may not seem like the time to buy into the Ohio State offense after their struggles against Northern Illinois. However, let's not blow one bad game out of proportion. This is still the talent-laden team most picked to win the title before the season. They'll figure it out, and there is a good chance it will happen against Western Michigan, who have given up 100 points in three games, including 43 to Georgia Southern in Week 2. Thomas is the No. 1 weapon in the passing game and, be it Cardale Jones or J.T. Barrett, somebody is going to get him the ball this week.\n\nRonnie Moore, WR, Bowling Green (at Purdue)\nBowling Green is throwing the ball with impunity. They lead the FBS in passing yards per game, and they have so far played a legitimate schedule free of cupcakes. Roger Lewis is the main guy you want, but, hopefully, at this point you don't have to be told to start Lewis. Moore hasn't played quite to the same level, but he still has 20 catches for 238 yards. He hasn't found the end zone yet, but, as we all know, that can change in the blink of an eye. The Boilermakers aren't likely to make it too difficult for him to score.\n\nDevonte Boyd, WR, UNLV (vs. Idaho State)\nIt has been a rough year for UNLV so far, but they have also had to play NIU, UCLA, and Michigan in their three outings. Despite that, Boyd has still managed 227 yards and two touchdowns. He'll finally get to go up against a manageable opponent in Idaho State. This is the Rebels' chance to get their offense going, and Boyd should be the main conduit through which that happens.\n\n\nPLAYERS TO SIT\n\nJoshua Dobbs, QB, Tennessee (at Florida)\nDobbs was thought of before the season as the guy to finally settle things under center for the Volunteers, but so far he has been, at best, adequate. He hasn't thrown for more than 205 yards in a game, and he has yet to throw for more than two touchdowns in a game either, although he has added a couple of touchdowns on the ground. However, in a double overtime game against Oklahoma he only went 13-for-31 for 125 yards, one touchdown, and one pick. A road trip to Florida is an even tougher proposition, as the Gators remain strong on defense, particularly in the secondary. This will not be the week Dobbs takes it to the next level, if he even starts, as there are now rumblings that he might not.\n\nBlake Frohnapfel, QB, Massachusetts (at Notre Dame)\nFrohnapfel's game last week against Temple - 393 yards with three touchdowns and one interception - was impressive, especially given how good the Owls have been so far. However, his season-opening performance against Colorado was less impressive. Despite Temple looking legit and despite Notre Dame's injuries, this is still Frohnapfel's toughest matchup so far. Even if you think he's capable of doing reasonably well, and he probably is, do you want to settle for \"reasonably well\" when there are so many more palatable matchups out there? The potential reward simply is not worth the risk here.\n\nThomas Sirk, QB, Duke (vs. Georgia Tech)\nSirk and the Blue Devils got a dose of reality last week when they finally faced a real defense in Northwestern. Though they were at home, Sirk only managed 150 yards passing with one interception, although he did also run for 61 yards and a score. Georgia Tech may be stinging a bit after their loss to the Fighting Irish, but their defense will provide enough of a challenge to curb any enthusiasm for Sirk.\n\nJarvion Franklin, RB, Western Michigan (at Ohio State)\nOh, Franklin's freshman season was fun for fantasy owners who stumbled upon him early and rode his 1,500 yards and 24 rushing touchdowns to fantasy glory. This year, though, has led to murmurings about the ol' sophomore slump more than anything else. He did manage to run for 161 yards and a touchdown on 27 carries last week, but that was against Murray State. Even with that game, he has just 242 rushing yards and one score on the season. In their opener, Franklin was limited to 47 total yards by Michigan State, and the Buckeyes aren't really a better matchup.\n\nDonnel Pumphrey, RB, San Diego State (at Penn State)\nLosing to South Alabama probably wasn't in the plans for the Aztecs, one assumes, yet that happened last week. Pumphrey did his best, but he still only gained 102 yards on 28 carries with a touchdown, although he also caught five passes for 55 yards. He's way off last season's pace, and the Nittany Lions are letting up just 293.7 yards of total offense so far, and 208 of that has been through the air. That doesn't bode well for Pumphrey.\n\nMichael Gordon, RB, Arkansas State (at Toledo)\nThe injury to Fredi Knighten has complicated things a bit for the Arkansas State offense, but it still has been a slow start for Gordon. Admittedly, the Red Wolves were merciful on Missouri State, only giving Gordon nine carries, which he took for 92 yards and a touchdown. Against FBS opponents, he has been less impressive, netting 120 yards on 28 carries. Toledo's defense is probably somewhere in between Missouri State and, say, Missouri, who Arkansas State also played. The Rockets should be tough enough to make things difficult for Gordon, even if Knighten returns.\n\nJohnny Holton, WR, Cincinnati (at Memphis)\nHolton leads the Bearcats with 167 receiving yards and two touchdowns. Those numbers are fine, but Holton is really here as a stand-in for the Cincinnati offense as a whole. Gunner Kiel is doubtful for Saturday's game against Memphis. Given that, it wouldn't be terribly helpful to list him as a player to sit, but without Kiel, there is no reason to play anybody from Cincinnati's offense, especially with Memphis being a tough defense on top of everything else.\n\nD'haquille Williams, WR, Auburn (vs. Mississippi State)\nAuburn's season hit a new low last week when the Tigers got housed by those other Tigers from LSU. The now-benched Jeremy Johnson gets the brunt of the scorn, at least on offense, but Williams has not impressed, either. He only has seven catches for 81 yards and one touchdown, and even running back Roc Thomas has more receiving yards. Mississippi State has been respectable defensively to this point. If nothing else, they will provide more of a challenge than Jacksonville State, and that may be too much of a challenge for Auburn...and Williams.\n\nJordan Williams, WR, Ball State (vs. Northwestern)\nIt has been a disappointing season for receivers named Williams, apparently, and this doesn't even take into account injured Clemson receiver Mike Williams. Ball State's Williams has yet to eclipse 100 yards on the season despite games against VMI and Eastern Michigan. Northwestern, meanwhile, has been quite feisty on defense en route to a surprise start. If Williams couldn't impress against VMI, it seems unlikely he'll do it against the Wildcats.\n"}, null, {"headline": "Week 4 Picks", "story": "This article will break down the Fanduel early slate for Saturday.\n\nCASH GAME TARGETS\n\nQUARTERBACK\n\nMatt Johnson - Bowling Green at Purdue ($8,600)\n\nThere are many fine quarterback options on this slate, but for cash game purposes, it'll be hard to pass on Johnson. His price makes him the seventh-most expensive quarterback on the slate, but this is a guy with 1,358 yards (9.2 YPA) and 12 touchdowns in his first three games back from a hip injury that ended his 2014 season. Johnson has fantastic receivers and heads into a game where Bowling Green is projected to score roughly 40 points.\n\nHonorable mention: Trevone Boykin - TCU at Texas Tech ($10,300), Pat Mahomes - Texas Tech vs. TCU ($8,700), Jake Browning - Washington vs. California ($6,800), Thomas Sirk - Duke vs. Georgia Tech ($6,800)\n\nRUNNING BACK\n\nMadre London - Michigan State vs. Central Michigan ($6,800)\n\nPatrick Skov keeps ending up on this list for obvious reasons, so for the sake of changing things up I'll write up London's situation. London has a home matchup against Central Michigan in a game where the Spartans are projected to score roughly 40 points. London's 48 carries are 13 more than the next runner, LJ Scott, and London has a good chance to lay claim to at least one of Michigan State's touchdowns after going 35 carries without a score.\n\nHonorable mention: Patrick Skov - Georgia Tech at Duke ($5,800), Travis Greene - Bowling Green at Purdue ($6,200)\n\nWIDE RECEIVER\n\nAaron Burbridge, Michigan State vs. Central Michigan ($6,800)\n\nLike Tony Lippett last year, Burbridge has emerged as the clear WR1 to quarterback Connor Cook, who has constantly looked for Burbridge as his first read. Burbridge somehow owns 20 of Michigan State's 50 completed passes, totaling 374 yards and four touchdowns. With over 100 yards or a touchdown in each game so far in 2015, Burbridge is an ideal cash-game target.\n\nTaywan Taylor - Western Kentucky vs. Miami (OH) ($6,100)\n\nTaylor is very tough to pass on at this price. Jared Dangerfield (hamstring) could near full health soon, but even when that happens, Taylor should still own an elevated role in the Western Kentucky offense as the Hilltoppers try to account for the lost production of Leon Allen (knee), who was very active as a pass catcher when healthy. Meanwhile, Miami (OH) just doesn't have the personnel to match WKU.\n\nHonorable mention: Isaiah Ford - Virginia Tech at East Carolina ($6,300), Ryan Burbrink - Bowling Green at Purdue ($5,400)\n\nTIGHT END\n\nTyler Higbee, Western Kentucky vs. Miami (OH) ($3,700)\n\nThere are a couple other good tight end candidates on this slate, especially Stephen Anderson (California) and Bucky Hodges (Virginia Tech), but I can't find a reason to not pay up for Higbee. He's been Western Kentucky's leading pass catcher so far and offers WR2-type production at a very cheap price.\n\nTOURNAMENT-SPECIFIC TARGETS\n\nQUARTERBACK\n\nKendall Hinton - Wake Forest vs. Indiana ($7,000)\n\nFirst of all, players like Trevone Boykin, Matt Johnson and Pat Mahomes are all great tournament quarterbacks this week, too, but this blurb will briefly point out the more obscure Hinton for those looking for a more under-the-radar target. Hinton should be a fairly trendy low-dollar pick after showing dual-threat upside in place of the injured John Wolford (ankle) against Army last week. Hinton finished that game throwing for 159 yards (5.9 YPA) and two interceptions, but showed rushing upside by running for 101 yards and two touchdowns on 17 carries. Hinton is very raw as a passer, but Indiana's pass defense has been atrocious, allowing 392.7 yards (9.4 YPA) per game while allowing 10 touchdowns in three contests.\n\nHonorable mention: Trevone Boykin - TCU at Texas Tech ($10,300), Pat Mahomes - Texas Tech vs. TCU ($8,700), Jake Browning - Washington vs. California ($6,800), Thomas Sirk - Duke vs. Georgia Tech ($6,800)\n\nRUNNING BACK\n\nC.J. Prosise, Notre Dame vs. Massachusetts ($8,400)\n\nThere are a number of tempting running back targets on this slate, including Ezekiel Elliott, Leonard Fournette and Jordan Howard, but Prosise probably offers similar fantasy upside with lower ownership numbers. Prosise carried the Notre Dame offense against Georgia Tech last week, bolting for 198 yards and three touchdowns on just 22 carries. Massachusetts' defense likely cannot slow Prosise down, let alone stop him, and the Irish are projected to score over 40 points.\n\nHonorable mention: Leonard Fournette - LSU at Syracuse ($8,700), Jordan Howard - Indiana at Wake Forest ($8,500), Patrick Skov - Georgia Tech at Duke ($5,800)\n\nWIDE RECEIVER\n\nJosh Doctson - TCU at Texas Tech ($8,400)\n\nDoctson is the most expensive receiver on this slate, but he's certainly worth making room for in a tournament lineup at the very least. He's also an extremely good cash game fit from a reliability standpoint, though his price obviously could cut into your strength at other positions. Kolby Listenbee missed some practice time this week with an undisclosed injury, so Doctson could see even more targets than usual in an offense where he already dominates targets. There's obvious triple-digit yardage, multi-touchdown upside here.\n\nHonorable mention: Roger Lewis - Bowling Green at Purdue ($7,600), Taywan Taylor - Western Kentucky vs. Miami (OH) ($6,100),  Devin Lauderdale - Texas Tech vs. TCU ($5,800)\n\nFADES\n\nQUARTERBACK\n\nSeth Russell, Baylor vs. Rice ($9,800)\n\nRussell is a player I hyped a lot before this year and still have high hopes for, but a four-turnover game against Lamar raises questions. I fully expect a bounce-back game from Russell, but his disappointing Week 2 showing combined with his high price makes it hard to justify taking him over Johnson or Mahomes outside of a tournament setting.\n\nRUNNING BACK\n\nJarvion Franklin - Western Michigan at Ohio State ($8,200)\n\nFranklin was held to 23 yards on eight carries against Michigan State in Week 1, and Georgia Southern held him to 58 yards on 17 carries in Week 2. Franklin can stomp MAC competition, but it's hard to see why he would excel against Ohio State this week.\n\nWIDE RECEIVER\n\nKD Cannon - Baylor vs. Rice ($6,800)\n\nThe supremely explosive Cannon is a tempting target in almost any lineup, especially tournament scenarios, but it's hard to justify buying him at this price. Cannon doesn't have the most predictable usage in the Baylor offense, so his big games aren't easy to anticipate. The upside is intoxicating, but there are players cheaper than Cannon this week who offer similar appeal. One is his own teammate, Jay Lee, priced at $6,400, as well as Devin Lauderdale at $5,800.

Particularly of late, the Rays' outfielder has performed at a level which renders him worth considering for the next eight days. Forgotten on a team likely headed for a sub-.500 finish, Kiermaier is one of 15 players with at least 10 home runs and 18 stolen bases. Owned in just 7 percent of Yahoo leagues, he is widely available and could be a toolsy solution for owners.\n\nOther Recent Recommendations: Steve Pearce, Mikie Mahtook, Jorge Lopez, Tyler Duffey, Starlin Castro and Justin Bour.\n\nDraft Kings Value Picks\n\nSP: Alex Wood, ATL ($6,200)\nC: Blake Swihart, BOS ($3,000)\n1B: Victor Martinez, DET ($3,500)\n2B: Hector Olivera, ATL ($2,800)\nSS: Ian Desmond, WAS ($3,300)\n3B: Anthony Rendon, WAS ($3,800)\nOF: Jacoby Ellsbury, NYY ($3,600)"}, null, {"headline": "Gridiron Wrestle Mania", "story": "In a column named after a high-flying offensive scheme that is designed to put points on the board in the blink of an eye, largely by aerial assault, we're going to talk about running backs this week.  Yes, I realize the irony.  With the rousing success of last week's rap column, I'm going to return to the comparisons.  Instead of channeling my inner Notorious B.I.G., though, I'll compare some of the top running backs in the nation to some of my favorite wrestlers of all-time.  The fake wrestling.  Yes, everyone is well aware it's fake.  It's a male soap opera.  Up until about the age of 16-17, that was my jam.  So this will have a slight bias toward the era of wrestlers I saw (late 1980s through early 2000s).  Sorry, John Cena.\n\nLSU's Leonard Fournette - The Rock\n\n\"It doesn't matter what your name is!\" That's what Leonard Fournette must think when he barrels over an unsuspecting defender, or jukes another helpless linebacker out of his jock strap.  Fournette has drawn comparisons to Adrian Peterson and Herschel Walker.  I've also heard Lawrence Phillips and even Bo Jackson. He gets the honor of being compared to Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson because of his versatility.  Not only can Fournette physically dominate the opposition at 6-foot-1, 230, but he also has the agility and quickness to make tacklers miss, as well as the breakaway speed to hit the home run.  As The Rock has morphed from wrestling icon into one of the most popular actors in the world, so too will Fournette eventually come to have millions ... and millions ... of fans.  The LSU running back has rushed for 631 yards and eight touchdowns in three games.  He's third in the nation in rushing and has played one fewer game than nearly every other running back.  He's averaging an absurd 8.6 yards per carries.  The Heisman voters are sure to smell what Fournette is cooking.\n\nOther possibilities: Andre The Giant, The Undertaker  \n\nGeorgia's Nick Chubb - Ric Flair\n\nWoooooo!  Did anybody ever really want to face Ric Flair?  Sure, he was a little older than most of his opponents, nearly all the time, and he wrestled forever, but that familiarity also seemed to work to his advantage.  And when he got that wide-eyed look, even if you knew the patented slap across the chest was coming, there was still nothing you could do to stop it.  Nick Chubb was the known commodity heading into the 2015 campaign, but that still has not made him any less dangerous.  Chubb entered the season with eight consecutive 100-yard rushing games.  That number has now climbed to 12, tying the school record set by the aforementioned Herschel Walker.  Chubb will look to set the mark Saturday against a ferocious Alabama front seven, but it would be a mistake to count him out.  That's just what The Nature Boy would have wanted.\n\nOther possibilities: Hulk Hogan, Stone Cold Steve Austin\n\nUCLA's Paul Perkins - Mankind\n\nPerkins is not the quickest running back, nor the strongest.  He plays on the West Coast, and as a result suffers a little bit from the East Coast/SEC bias.  Quarterback Brett Hundley got all the attention in 2014, as Perkins ran for about the quietest 1,500 yards in NCAA history.  In 2015, true freshman gunslinger Josh Rosen has been hyped as the next great quarterback, leaving Perkins in the background despite the 4-0 start for the Bruins.  Just as Perkins has received almost no publicity for his stellar play on the field, so too did Mankind a/k/a Mick Foley.  However, despite not being the biggest or most athletic, Perkins' work ethic and no-nonsense attitude has allowed him to succeed out of the spotlight.  Foley was revered for his ability to take punishment, and at 5-10, 210, Perkins knows sometimes going up the middle he's going to get battered and bruised.  Even his quiet demeanor fits Foley's profile, as the quirky Foley only reluctantly began to use his orating skills later in his career with whacky characters like Cactus Jack and SockO.  Perkins does not have to resort to any gimmicks for UCLA, though, as 514 yards and six touchdowns through four games for the undefeated Bruins speak for themselves.\n\nOther possibilities: Kurt Angle, Sgt. Slaughter\n\nIndiana's Jordan Howard - Chris Jericho\n\nY2J is perhaps one of the most underappreciated wrestlers of all time.  A six-time world champion and record nine-time Intercontinental Champion, the Canadian-born Jericho has wrestled for nearly two decades in the public spotlight, constantly reshaping, reimagining and reinventing his character.  He was incredibly consistent, even when other stars received more notoriety.  Jordan Howard of the Indiana Hoosiers is the leading rusher in college football through four games.  Yes, you read that correctly.  Not Fournette.  Not Chubb.  Not Perkins.  Howard rushed for 1,587 yards and 13 touchdowns last season -- and he wasn't even the leading rusher on his own team!  That honor went to Tevin Coleman, who ran for 2,036 yards and 15 scores and now plays for the Atlanta Falcons.  With the starting job all to his own in 2015, Howard has rushed for at least 145 yards in every game in 2015.  The only downside for Howard is that the Hoosiers have not yet started conference play, and their first game pits them against the No. 1 team in the country, the Ohio State Buckeyes.  We're going to see really quickly if Howard can do to OSU what he did to FIU and Southern Illinois.\n\nOther possibilities: Bret \"The Hitman\" Hart, Shawn Michaels\n\nUtah's Devontae Booker - Triple H\n\nBooker might be my favorite back in college football.  I'll be honest; Hunter Hearst Helmsley was never one of my favorite wrestlers.  However, I think that was kind of the point.  For large chunks of his career, he was hated.  And you were supposed to hate him.  As the leader of Degeneration X, his pompous attitude wore exceedingly thin, when I just wanted to see Stone Cold Steve Austin guzzle beers and give Vince McMahon the Stone Cold Stunner.  Still, you had to respect Triple H's talents. And he commanded your attention. Not in the same way the Rock did, but merely by his presence.  His bravado.  His stare.  When Triple H was in the ring, you knew it was going to take somebody's best to beat him.  When I see Booker line up in the backfield, that's what I see.  The Utes made a choice to tell the world that they were going to feed Booker 25-30 times in every game.  That was their plan.  Teams come into the game knowing they will have to stop Booker to beat Utah.  And they still can't do it.  Only one back in college football has more touches than Booker through four games, and that is Justin Jackson of Northwestern.  Booker is averaging more than 100 yards rushing per game when the opposition knows he's going to be fed the ball.  Of course, Utah has been anything but a one-trick pony this season.  The Utes are undefeated and have had stellar play from quarterback Travis Wilson as well as their defense.  Wilson scored five times in Saturday's 62-20 massacre in Eugene against the Ducks.  But it all comes back to Booker.  Wilson can shine because of all the attention given to Booker.  In that respect, he's just like Triple H.  Suck it. (Had to throw that in there).\n\nOther possibilities: \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage, Razor Ramon"}]
